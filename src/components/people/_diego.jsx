						<p>
Diego Ramos is a Mexican director, screenwriter, playwright, and musician. He was born on July 8th, 1998. His love and passion for film began at a very young age when he saw Jurassic Park for the first time; the special effects blew him away, and he just knew he had to be part of that world. He began writing short stories as a child and continues to write stories to this very day.
