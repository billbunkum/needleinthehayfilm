# "Needle in the Hay" short film
- A teaser film for the Feature Film coming 2026

- "In a gritty, dimly lit apartment, a washed-up musician teeters on the edge of self-destruction, haunted by his past and crushed by his present. When his fed-up landlord storms in demanding overdue rent his loyal but exasperated Music Producer has to decide whether to get involved or not. Needle in the Hay is a raw, tension-filled drama about broken dreams, fractured relationships, and the fragile hope for redemption."
